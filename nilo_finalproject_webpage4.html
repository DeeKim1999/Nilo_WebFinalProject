										<hr/>
										<p class="overview-text">
											In a small town of Agno, Pangasinan, nestled amidst serene landscapes and close-knit communities, a remarkable idea took root from a fundamental need. Here, students longed for affordable school supplies and books, yet were faced with the daunting task of trekking nearly an hour to the nearest city to fulfill these basic requirements. The absence of accessible resources sparked a profound realization and ignited a fervent desire to devise a solution that could transform the educational landscape of the entire community. We believe in the inherent potential of every student and strive to provide them with the tools and resources needed to realize their aspirations and dreams.
										</p>
										<p class="overview-text">
											Thus, Jovy's Scholar Station was conceived—an embodiment of the local community's aspirations for educational empowerment, discourse, and enlightenment. Driven by an unwavering commitment to bridge this gap, Jovy's Scholar Station emerged as a beacon of hope, strategically situated in the heart of Agno. Our modest establishment swiftly evolved into a cornerstone of support for students, offering not merely books and school supplies, but also fostering a sense of camaraderie and potential.
										</p>
										<p class="overview-text">
											As our humble bookstore flourished, so did our vision to embolden young minds through the power of knowledge and ingenuity. We ardently seek to instill a profound love for learning among students of all ages, transcending geographical barriers and reaching the farthest corners of remote areas. Our journey is one of resilience, determination, and unwavering dedication to the noble cause of educational accessibility and empowerment.
											Anchored by our core values of inclusivity, integrity, and innovation, Jovy's Scholar Station stands as a testament to the transformative impact of education on individuals and communities alike. Our commitment to excellence and social responsibility drives us forward, to continuously evolve and adapt.
